Description: 
A dynamic volume mixer with process icons that reflects the windows volume mixer. Control each independent process' volume as applications open and close. No need to statically assign a button to
a single application, the application placeholder actions will update accordingly.

IMPORTANT: To have the plugin work best and provide as many process icons as possible, please ensure you are running your Stream Deck app as an administrator. See "Troubleshooting" for more details.

Features: 
Inline Controls
Have a small stream deck? Instead of dedicating buttons to volume controls, only show controls when you select an application you want to control.

Static Applications
Want an application to stay on the same key regardless if it's open or not? Make it static.
		
Application Blacklisting
Have an application you know you will never want to control? Add it to your blacklist to prevent it from being displayed on your Stream Deck.

Release Notes: 

- Fixed issue with the plugin not working due to administrator priveledges. 
- Fixes issue with applications not populating on initialization.
