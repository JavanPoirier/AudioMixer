Description: 
A dynamic volume mixer with process icons that reflects the windows volume mixer. Control each independent process' volume as applications open and close. No need to statically assign a button to
a single application, the application placeholder actions will update accordingly.

IMPORTANT: To have the plugin work best and provide as many process icons as possible, please ensure you are running your Stream Deck app as an administrator. See "Troubleshooting" for more details.
